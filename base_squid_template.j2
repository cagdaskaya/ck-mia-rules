### SQUID STAGE CONFIG ###

## Prevent caching jsp, cgi-bin etc
#acl QUERY urlpath_regex cgi-bin \? asp aspx jsp
#acl QUERY urlpath_regex \*
#cache deny QUERY

## Prevent all caching
cache deny all

## Only allow cachemgr access from localhost
http_access allow localhost manager
http_access deny manager

## We strongly recommend the following be uncommented to protect innocent
## web applications running on the proxy server who think the only
## one who can access services on "localhost" is a local user
http_access deny to_localhost

##
## INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
##

## ACLs are defined here
## The first part of the acl is the name, the second part is the type, and the third part is the value

{% for acl_name, acl_list in acls.items() %}
{% for acl in acl_list %}
acl {{ acl_name }} {{ acl.type }} {{ acl.value }}
{% endfor %}

{% endfor %}

## Rules are defined here
## The first part of the rule is the action, the second part is the ACLs to apply the action to

{% for rule in rules %}
http_access {{ rule.action }} {{ rule.acl }}
{% endfor %}

## And finally deny all other access to this proxy
http_access deny all

## Squid listens to port 8080
http_port 0.0.0.0:8080
## If you have multiple interfaces you can specify to listen on one IP like this:
#http_port 1.2.3.4:8080

## Uncomment and adjust the following to add a disk cache directory.
## 1024 is the disk space to use for cache in MB, adjust as you see fit!
## Default is no disk cache
#cache_dir ufs /var/cache/squid 1024 16 256
## Better, use 'aufs' cache type, see
##http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_dir/ for info.
#cache_dir aufs /var/cache/squid 1024 16 256
## Recommended to only change cache type when squid is stopped, and use 'squid -z' to
## ensure cache is (re)created correctly

## Leave coredumps in the first cache dir
#coredump_dir /var/cache/squid

## Where does Squid log to?
access_log /var/log/squid/access.log
access_log syslog:local5.info squid

## Use the below to turn off access logging
#access_log none
## When logging, web auditors want to see the full uri, even with the query terms
strip_query_terms off
## Keep 7 days of logs
logfile_rotate 7

## How much RAM, in MB, to use for cache? Default since squid 3.1 is 256 MB
cache_mem 64 MB

## Maximum size of individual objects to store in cache
maximum_object_size 1 MB

## Amount of data to buffer from server to client
read_ahead_gap 64 KB

## Use X-Forwarded-For header?
## Some consider this a privacy/security risk so it is often disabled
## However it can be useful to identify misbehaving/problematic clients
#forwarded_for on
forwarded_for delete

## Suppress sending squid version information
httpd_suppress_version_string on

## How long to wait when shutting down squid
shutdown_lifetime 30 seconds

## Replace the User Agent header.  Be sure to deny the header first, then replace it :)
#request_header_access User-Agent deny all
#request_header_replace User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 9.0; en-US)

## What hostname to display? (defaults to system hostname)
#visible_hostname a_proxy

## Use a different hosts file?
#hosts_file /path/to/file

## Add any of your own refresh_pattern entries above these.
refresh_pattern ^ftp:       1440    20% 10080
refresh_pattern ^gopher:    1440    0%  1440
refresh_pattern -i (/cgi-bin/|\?) 0 0%  0
refresh_pattern .       0   20% 4320
